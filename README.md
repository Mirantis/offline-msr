Utilities for installing MSR offline

Currently images can be pulled using get_msr.sh utility
Here is an example output:
```
cert-manager-v1.7.2.tgz
msr-1.0.6.tgz
postgres-operator-1.7.1.tgz
msr-3.0.5.tar
```

TGZ files contain backed-up helm charts and TAR file has all images for MSR and all references for helm files
